# Sample SpiraApp: Change Test Case Type

This sample demonstrates how you can write a SpiraApp to change
the type of a test case based on the value selected in a specific
test case field.

It was developed for a customer that was looking for a way to change
the type of a test case from manual to automated so that it would
be able to use a different workflow once the test case was
marked as being ready for automation.
